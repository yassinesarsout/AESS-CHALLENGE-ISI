### **Project Proposal: Interconnected CubeSat Network for Internet Connectivity and Environmental Monitoring**

---

#### **Overview**  
Our project aims to deploy a **network of CubeSats** that communicate with each other to provide **internet connectivity** to remote and underserved areas on Earth. Additionally, each CubeSat is equipped with specialized sensors to monitor various aspects of the Earth's environment, including plant health, ocean conditions, and air quality. This dual-purpose system addresses critical challenges in global connectivity and environmental sustainability.

#### **Motivation and Problem Statement**  
1. **Connectivity Challenges**:  
   - Millions of people lack access to reliable internet due to geographical isolation, such as in mountainous regions, deserts, and remote islands.  
   - Traditional internet infrastructure (e.g., fiber optics, cell towers) is costly and impractical in these areas.  

2. **Environmental Challenges**:  
   - Increasing climate change effects necessitate comprehensive monitoring of environmental parameters.  
   - Existing ground-based monitoring systems are limited in scope and coverage, especially in remote or inaccessible areas.  

Our project bridges these gaps by creating a CubeSat network capable of addressing both issues simultaneously.
