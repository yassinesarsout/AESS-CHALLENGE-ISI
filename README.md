### **Expanded Document: Interconnected CubeSat Network for Internet Connectivity and Environmental Monitoring**

---

#### **1. Overview**  
This project introduces a scalable network of CubeSats designed to address two key global issues: internet accessibility and environmental monitoring. The interconnected satellites will relay internet services to remote areas while collecting valuable data on plant health, ocean conditions, and air quality. The dual-purpose system is modular, ensuring adaptability for future expansion.

#### **2. Motivation and Problem Statement**

##### **Connectivity Challenges**  
- Over **2.7 billion people** globally remain offline due to geographical constraints or financial limitations.  
- Traditional infrastructure like fiber optics is expensive and logistically difficult to deploy in remote regions (e.g., deserts, mountainous terrains, and isolated islands).  
- The lack of internet access hinders education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, perpetuating poverty and inequality.

##### **Environmental Challenges**  
- **Climate change** and human activities are significantly affecting ecosystems. For example:
  - Agriculture faces declining yields due to unpredictable weather and soil degradation.  
  - Oceans are suffering from pollution, overfishing, and rising temperatures.  
  - Air quality in urban and industrial areas continues to worsen, impacting public health.  
- Current monitoring systems are limited in coverage, accuracy, and timeliness, leaving many regions under-observed.

#### **3. Project Objectives**

##### **Internet Connectivity**  
- Provide affordable, reliable internet access to remote and underserved communities using satellite-based networks.  
- Facilitate real-time communication, bridging digital divides in education, telemedicine, and local economies.

##### **Environmental Monitoring**  
- Create a network capable of monitoring:
  - **Agriculture**: Crop health, soil moisture, and stress detection.  
  - **Oceans**: Pollution levels, temperature changes, and marine ecosystem health.  
  - **Air Quality**: Greenhouse gases, particulate matter, and pollution trends.  

##### **Data Integration**  
- Develop a robust inter-satellite communication system to:
  - Share data between CubeSats for better coordination.  
  - Relay processed data to ground stations for immediate access and analysis.

#### **4. System Architecture**

##### **4.1 CubeSat Network Design**  
- **Mesh Network**:  
  - Each CubeSat communicates with neighboring satellites to relay data efficiently.  
  - This architecture ensures redundancy; if one satellite fails, others can compensate.  

- **Ground Stations**:  
  - Centralized nodes for receiving data, managing satellite commands, and distributing internet to end-users.  
  - Ground stations connect to global internet gateways and distribute localized access through Wi-Fi or cellular hotspots.

##### **4.2 Specialized Sensors on CubeSats**  
- **Agriculture Monitoring CubeSat**:  
  - **Multispectral/hyperspectral cameras** to capture images at specific wavelengths for analyzing plant health.  
  - Algorithms calculate vegetation indices like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to detect drought, pest infestations, or nutrient deficiencies.

- **Ocean Monitoring CubeSat**:  
  - Sensors for water temperature, salinity, pH, turbidity, and chlorophyll concentration.  
  - Monitors ocean pollution (e.g., plastic debris) and supports fisheries by analyzing marine habitats.

- **Air Quality Monitoring CubeSat**:  
  - Sensors for measuring CO₂, methane, PM2.5, and NOx levels.  
  - Tracks urban air pollution, industrial emissions, and trends in greenhouse gas concentrations.

##### **4.3 Internet Provisioning**  
- **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)**:
  - Satellites orbit between 500–1,200 km to provide low-latency internet connections.  
- **Data Relay**:
  - Signals bounce between CubeSats to bypass line-of-sight limitations, ensuring global coverage.
