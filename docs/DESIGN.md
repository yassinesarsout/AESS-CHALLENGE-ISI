# **Design Overview:**
- **Dimensions:** 
Standard 3U CubeSat.

- **Solar Panels:** 
Four sides of deployable solar panels forming an umbrella-like structure when extended, maximizing power generation in orbit.

- **Top 1U Section:** 
Houses core systems like power management, processing units, attitude control, and communication systems to ensure the CubeSat operates efficiently.

- **Bottom 2U Section:** 
Customizable payload space for various sensors and controllers:

- **Sensors:** 
Designed to monitor Earthâ€™s ecosystems, such as vegetation, water bodies, atmospheric composition, and more.

- **Controllers:** 
Adaptable to manage different sensor types, ensuring modularity for diverse missions.

- **Phased Array Antenna:** 
Located beneath the solar panels, optimized for high-speed communication with ground stations, akin to Starlink's design.
