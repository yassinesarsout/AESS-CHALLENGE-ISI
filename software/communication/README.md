### **Integration of Reusable and Cost-Effective Ground Control Software in Our CubeSat Network Project**  

---

#### **Introduction**  
To manage and monitor our CubeSat network for internet connectivity and environmental monitoring, we are adopting a **reusable and cost-effective ground control software solution** inspired by the architecture described in *“Toward a Reusable and Cost-effective Ground Control Software for CubeSat Missions.”* This approach allows us to streamline operations, ensure modularity, and reduce costs, aligning perfectly with the mission objectives of our project.  

Our CubeSat network is designed to provide internet access to underserved regions and monitor environmental factors such as plant health, ocean conditions, and air quality. Efficient ground control software is critical to managing these interconnected systems, processing large volumes of data, and maintaining seamless communication between CubeSats and ground stations.

#### **Why This Ground Control Software?**  
The described ground control software architecture offers:  
1. **Modularity**: Facilitates the addition and removal of subsystems like new sensors or communication protocols without disrupting the overall system.  
2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reuses open-source tools like GPredict and CSP to minimize development expenses.  
3. **Scalability**: Easily adapts to future expansions of the CubeSat network or new functionalities.  
4. **Flexibility**: Combines desktop and web-based solutions, allowing both local and remote access for mission operations.  
5. **Visualization**: Enables real-time telemetry monitoring and interactive dashboards for actionable insights.

#### **Key Features of the Integrated System**  

##### **1. Modular and Reusable Architecture**  
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Each CubeSat subsystem (e.g., communication, energy management, sensor payloads) operates as an independent service.  
- **Client-Server Model**: Ensures seamless interactions between CubeSats and the ground station.  
- **MVC Pattern**: Separates application logic into model, view, and controller components for better maintainability and scalability.  

##### **2. Telemetry, Telecommand, and Data Management**  
- Supports real-time telemetry for monitoring CubeSat health and performance.  
- Provides manual and bulk telecommands to reconfigure sensors or optimize communication.  
- Stores mission data, including environmental observations and internet performance metrics, in a centralized MongoDB database.  

##### **3. Data Visualization**  
- Real-time dashboards built using React and visualization libraries like D3.js.  
- Graphical representations of sensor data, such as NDVI maps for crop health or pollution indices for air and water quality.  

##### **4. Communication Protocols**  
- Uses CubeSat Space Protocol (CSP) for lightweight and efficient communication between CubeSats and the ground station.  
- Integrates GPredict for satellite tracking, orbit prediction, and scheduling communication windows.  

##### **5. Role-Based Access Control**  
- **Administrator Role**: Full access to mission controls, including sending telecommands and configuring sensors.  
- **Remote User Role**: View-only access to dashboards for monitoring environmental data and connectivity metrics.

##### **1. Ground Control Operations**  
- **Pre-Pass Phase**:  
  - Use GPredict to schedule communication windows based on CubeSat orbits.  
  - Configure antennas and radios for optimal signal reception.  

- **Active Communication Phase**:  
  - Receive real-time telemetry from CubeSats, including system health and sensor data.  
  - Parse and log received data for analysis and visualization.  
  - Execute telecommands for system adjustments, such as modifying data collection intervals or reorienting CubeSats.  

- **Post-Pass Phase**:  
  - Log all mission activities and received data for archival and troubleshooting.  
  - Update dashboards with new data for user access.  

##### **2. Data Processing and Visualization**  
- Environmental data collected by CubeSats (e.g., air quality, water parameters, vegetation indices) is processed and stored in MongoDB.  
- Dashboards display this data in an intuitive format, enabling quick decision-making by stakeholders.  

##### **3. Internet Connectivity Management**  
- Monitor CubeSat network performance, including latency and bandwidth usage, through dedicated dashboards.  
- Optimize data relay routes among CubeSats to ensure uninterrupted connectivity.
